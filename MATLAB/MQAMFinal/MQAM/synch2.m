% find the cross-correlation of the received and the training sequence

x = abs(x_complex);  %we want to compare the absolute values for different 
     
%time shifts


size_x=size(x);

[value, offset] = max(x);
%sampling time is given by the positive time shift that maximizes the cross 
%correlation:
n_samp = (offset - (size_x(2)+1)/2);
