Description:
        In order to install DR DOS you must make sure that you are
        booting from a floppy in drive A:. DR DOS will not install
        from drive B:. DR DOS comes on 3 1/2 inch low density
        floppies and 5 1/4 inch Hi-density floppies. If you need
        5 1/4 inch low-density disks (360K) send in the coupon that
        comes with your DR DOS.

        If the boot disk hangs while trying to load, usually it means
        there is an incompatible or faulty piece of hardware.

	One of the things it can be is simply an older floppy 
	drive that is Out of alignment.  Sometimes the situation
	can be salvaged by fkrmatting a floppy on the boo4 drive
	si4h 4hq kld DNS, phen doinga divkckpy. he potentcIl(-ˆ‰XðïJlmG cs¢|Bat the diskcopy may not be able to read the 
	boot disk either. If you can't make a backup then it may 
	be necessary to get a rapÌacemeÌt diSi SÇÔ fxOÏ€DËÇiÖÁL¥
	Research (iN case there is an actual error with the disk,
	which does sometime happen) or see about getting the 
	drives aligned.

	********************************************************

	Another problem is where you can make valid Diskcopies 
	but all you get is the message "Loading...". Hare the
	potential problem may be the computer's bios. DR DOS 
	must be able to direct the system to the area where DOS
	Kernel files are located. Older b9osesare not able to 
	perform this function. If your bios dates from around
	1987 or earlier you maynaed aÎ ep`ate.

	And finally, if you can read the disks but are unable to 
	format a disk or make a diskcOpy DR DOS may think you 
	have a different type of floppy than you actually have.
	Another symptom of this is if you are making a floppy
	installation and DR DNS asks you for 5 1/4" floppies
	when you actually have 3 1/2" floxpims. If this is an XT
  ( ( |ypmcomp}ter (by which we meáni|has no CMOS config-
	urationprogram) then you can place a DRIVPARM state-
	ment in your CONFIG.SYS."Refer to the DR DNS man5dl p{

	drive you specify. If your computer does have a CMOS 
	setup program then you need to correct the entries for
        your floppy drives in CMOS.
