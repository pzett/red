Thompson completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, 
and transferred to Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois, to study electronics. 
He applied to become an aviator, but was rejected by the Air Force's aviation-cadet program. 
In 1956, he transferred to Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, Florida. While serving 
at Eglin, he took evening classes at Florida State University.[12] At Eglin, he landed his first 
professional writing job as sports editor of the The Command Courier by lying about his job 
experience. In this capacity, he covered the Eglin Eagles, a football team that included 
future professional players Bart Starr, Max McGee and Zeke Bratkowski. Thompson traveled 
with the team around the US, covering its games. In early 1957, he wrote a sports column 
for The Playground News, a local newspaper in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. He could not use 
his name on the column because the Air Force did not allow airmen to hold other jobs.[4]
 
Thompson was discharged from the Air Force in June 1958 as an Airman First Class, having been 
recommended for an early honorable discharge by his commanding officer. "In summary, this airman,
 although talented, will not be guided by policy", Col. William S. Evans, chief of information 
services wrote to the Eglin personnel office. "Sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems 
to rub off on other airmen staff members."[13]
 
Early journalism career[edit]
 
After the Air Force, he worked as sports editor for a newspaper in Jersey Shore, 
Pennsylvania,[14] before relocating to New York City. There he audited several courses 
at the Columbia University School of General Studies During this time he worked briefly 
for Time, as a copy boy for $51 a week. While working, he used a typewriter to copy F. 
Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms in order to 
learn about the writing styles of the authors. In 1959, Time fired him for insubordination.
[15] Later that year, he worked as a reporter for The Middletown Daily Record in Middletown, 
New York. He was fired from this job after damaging an office candy machine and arguing with
 the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper.[15]
 
In 1960, Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take a job with the sporting magazine 
El Sportivo, which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto 
Rican English language daily The San Juan Star, but its managing editor, future novelist 
William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends and after the demise 
of El Sportivo, Thompson worked as a stringer for the New York Herald Tribune and a few 
stateside papers on Caribbean issues with Kennedy working as his editor.[16][17] After 
returning to the States, Hunter hitchhiked across the United States along U.S. Hwy 40, 
eventually ending up in Big Sur, California working as a security guard and caretaker at
the Big Sur hot springs for an eight-month period in 1961, just before it became the Esalen 
Institute. While there, he published his first magazine feature in the nationally distributed 
Rogue magazine, on the artisan and bohemian culture of Big Sur. Thompson had had a rocky tenure 
as caretaker of the hot springs, and the unexpected publicity from the article finally got him 
fired. During this period, Thompson wrote two novels, Prince Jellyfish and The Rum Diary, and 
submitted many short stories to publishers with little success. The Rum Diary, a novel based on 
Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico, was eventually published in 1998, long after he had become famous.
 
From May 1962 to May 1963, Thompson traveled to South America as a correspondent for a Dow 
Jones-owned weekly newspaper, the National Observer. In Brazil, he spent several months as a 
reporter for the Brazil Herald, the country's only English-language daily, published in Rio de 
Janeiro. His longtime girlfriend Sandra Dawn Conklin (aka Sandy Conklin Thompson, now Sondi 
Wright) later joined him in Rio. They were married on May 19, 1963, shortly after returning to 
the United States, and lived briefly in Aspen, Colorado, where they had a son, Juan Fitzgerald 
Thompson (born March 23, 1964). The couple conceived five more times, but three pregnancies were 
miscarried, and the other two produced infants who died shortly after birth. Hunter and Sandy 
divorced in 1980 but always remained close friends.
 
In 1964, the family relocated to Glen Ellen, California, where Thompson continued to write for 
the National Observer on an array of domestic subjects. One story was about his 1964 visit to 
Ketchum, Idaho, to investigate the reasons for Ernest Hemingway's suicide.[18] While there, he 
stole a pair of elk antlers hanging above the front door of Hemingway's cabin. Thompson severed 
his ties with the Observer after his editor refused to print his review of Tom Wolfe's 1965 
essay collection The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,[19] and moved to San 
Francisco. He immersed himself in the drug and hippie culture that was taking root in the 
area, and soon began writing for the Berkeley underground paper The Spyder.[20]

Hell's Angels[edit]
See also: Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs
In 1965, Carey McWilliams, editor of The Nation, hired Thompson to write a story about 
the California-based Hells Angels* motorcycle club. After the article appeared (on May 17, 1965), Thompson received several book offers and spent the next year living and riding with the gang. The relationship broke down when the bikers perceived that Thompson was exploiting them for personal gain, and demanded a share of the profits from his writings. An argument at a party resulted in a savage beating for Thompson (or "stomping", as the Angels referred to it). Random House published the hard cover Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs* in 1966, and the fight between Thompson and the Angels was well-marketed. CBC Television even broadcast an encounter between Thompson and Hells Angel Skip Workman before a live studio audience.[21]
 
A reviewer for The New York Times praised it as an "angry, knowledgeable, fascinating and 
excitedly written book", that shows the Hells Angels "not so much as dropouts from society
 but as total misfits, or unfits — emotionally, intellectually and educationally unfit to 
achieve the rewards, such as they are, that the contemporary social order offers." The reviewer 
also praised Thompson as 

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas[edit]

Coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement is a major theme of
 the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being 
heralded by The New York Times as "by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope".
[32] "The Vegas Book", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced 
his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.
 
Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72[edit]
 
Main article: Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72
 
Within the next year, Thompson wrote extensively for 
Rolling Stone while covering the election campaigns of 
President Richard Nixon and his unsuccessful opponent, 
Senator George McGovern. The articles were soon combined 
and published as Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. 
As the title suggests, Thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling 
the "campaign trail", focusing largely on the Democratic Party's primaries 
(Nixon, as an incumbent, performed little campaign work) in which McGovern 
competed with rival candidates Edmund Muskie and Hubert Humphrey. Thompson was an 
early supporter of McGovern and wrote unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in 
the increasingly widely read Rolling Stone.

considered to be a major part of the New Journalism literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, 
which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the 
time. Thompson almost always wrote in the first person, while extensively using his own 
experiences and emotions to color "the story" he was trying to follow. His writing aimed to 
be humorous, colorful and bizarre, and he often exaggerated events to be more entertaining. 
The term Gonzo has since been applied in kind to numerous other forms of highly subjective 
artistic expression.
 
Despite his having personally described his work as "Gonzo", it fell to later observers to 
articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting 
himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, 
metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam 
of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. 
Thompson, in a 1974 Interview in Playboy addressed the issue himself, saying "Unlike Tom Wolfe 
or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters 
than I am, but then, I don't think of myself as a reporter." Tom Wolfe would later describe 
Thompson's style as "... part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild 
invention and wilder rhetoric."[52] Or as one description of the differences between Thompson 
and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, "While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on 
the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment."[53]
Thompson completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, 
and transferred to Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois, to study electronics.

the National Observer on an array of domestic subjects. One story was about his 1964 visit to 
Ketchum, Idaho, to investigate the reasons for Ernest Hemingway's suicide.[18] While there, he 
stole a pair of elk antlers hanging above the front door of Hemingway's cabin. Thompson severed 
his ties with the Observer after his editor refused to print his review of Tom Wolfe's 1965 
essay collection The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,[19] and moved to San 
Francisco. He immersed himself in the drug and hippie culture that was taking root in the 
area, and soon began writing for the Berkeley underground paper The Spyder.[20]

Hell's Angels[edit]

In 1965, Carey McWilliams, editor of The Nation, hired Thompson to write a story about 
the California-based Hells Angels* motorcycle club. After the article appeared (on May 17, 1965), Thompson received several book offers and spent the next year living and riding with the gang. The relationship broke down when the bikers perceived that Thompson was exploiting them for personal gain, and demanded a share of the profits from his writings. An argument at a party resulted in a savage beating for Thompson (or "stomping", as the Angels referred to it). Random House published the hard cover Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs* in 1966, and the fight between Thompson and the Angels was well-marketed. CBC Television even broadcast an encounter between Thompson and Hells Angel Skip Workman before a live studio audience.[21]
 
A reviewer for The New York Times praised it as an "angry, knowledgeable, fascinating and 
excitedly written book", that shows the Hells Angels "not so much as dropouts from society
 but as total misfits, or unfits — emotionally, intellectually and educationally unfit to 
achieve the rewards, such as they are, that the contemporary social order offers." The reviewer 
also praised Thompson as 

Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas[edit]

Coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement is a major theme of
 the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being 
heralded by The New York Times as "by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope".
[32] "The Vegas Book", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced 
his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.
 
Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72[edit]

Within the next year, Thompson wrote extensively for 
Rolling Stone while covering the election campaigns of 
President Richard Nixon and his unsuccessful opponent, 
Senator George McGovern. The articles were soon combined 
and published as Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. 
As the title suggests, Thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling 
the "campaign trail", focusing largely on the Democratic Party's primaries 
(Nixon, as an incumbent, performed little campaign work) in which McGovern 
competed with rival candidates Edmund Muskie and Hubert Humphrey. Thompson was an 
early supporter of McGovern and wrote unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in 
the increasingly widely read Rolling Stone.

considered to be a major part of the New Journalism literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, 
which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the 
time. Thompson almost always wrote in the first person, while extensively using his own 
experiences and emotions to color "the story" he was trying to follow. His writing aimed to 
be humorous, colorful and bizarre, and he often exaggerated events to be more entertaining. 
The term Gonzo has since been applied in kind to numerous other forms of highly subjective 
artistic expression.
 
Despite his having personally described his work as "Gonzo", it fell to later observers to 
articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting 
himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, 
metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam 
of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. 
Thompson, in a 1974 Interview in Playboy addressed the issue himself, saying "Unlike Tom Wolfe 
or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters 
than I am, but then, I don't think of myself as a reporter." Tom Wolfe would later describe 
Thompson's style as "... part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild 
invention and wilder rhetoric."[52] Or as one description of the differences between Thompson 
and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, "While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on 
the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a fly in the ointment."[53]
Thompson completed basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, 
and transferred to Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois, to study electronics. 
He applied to become an aviator, but was rejected by the Air Force's aviation-cadet program. 
In 1956, he transferred to Eglin Air Force Base near Fort Walton Beach, Florida. While serving 
at Eglin, he took evening classes at Florida State University.[12] At Eglin, he landed his first 
professional writing job as sports editor of the The Command Courier by lying about his job 
experience. In this capacity, he covered the Eglin Eagles, a football team that included 
future professional players Bart Starr, Max McGee and Zeke Bratkowski. Thompson traveled 
with the team around the US, covering its games. In early 1957, he wrote a sports column 
for The Playground News, a local newspaper in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. He could not use 
his name on the column because the Air Force did not allow airmen to hold other jobs.[4]
 
Thompson was discharged from the Air Force in June 1958 as an Airman First Class, having been 
recommended for an early honorable discharge by his commanding officer. "In summary, this airman,
 although talented, will not be guided by policy", Col. William S. Evans, chief of information 
services wrote to the Eglin personnel office. "Sometimes his rebel and superior attitude seems 
to rub off on other airmen staff members."[13]
 
Early journalism career[edit]
 
After the Air Force, he worked as sports editor for a newspaper in Jersey Shore, 
Pennsylvania,[14] before relocating to New York City. There he audited several courses 
at the Columbia University School of General Studies During this time he worked briefly 
for Time, as a copy boy for $51 a week. While working, he used a typewriter to copy F. 
Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms in order to 
learn about the writing styles of the authors. In 1959, Time fired him for insubordination.
[15] Later that year, he worked as a reporter for The Middletown Daily Record in Middletown, 
New York. He was fired from this job after damaging an office candy machine and arguing with
 the owner of a local restaurant who happened to be an advertiser with the paper.[15]
 
In 1960, Thompson moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to take a job with the sporting magazine 
El Sportivo, which folded soon after his arrival. Thompson applied for a job with the Puerto 
Rican English language daily The San Juan Star, but its managing editor, future novelist 
William J. Kennedy, turned him down. Nonetheless, the two became friends and after the demise 
of El Sportivo, Thompson worked as a stringer for the New York Herald Tribune and a few 
stateside papers on Caribbean issues with Kennedy working as his editor.[16][17] After 
returning to the States, Hunter hitchhiked across the United States along U.S. Hwy 40, 
eventually ending up in Big Sur, California working as a security guard and caretaker at
the Big Sur hot springs for an eight-month period in 1961, just before it became the Esalen 
Institute. While there, he published his first magazine feature in the nationally distributed 
Rogue magazine, on the artisan and bohemian culture of Big Sur. Thompson had had a rocky tenure 
as caretaker of the hot springs, and the unexpected publicity from the article finally got him 
fired. During this period, Thompson wrote two novels, Prince Jellyfish and The Rum Diary, and 
submitted many short stories to publishers with little success. The Rum Diary, a novel based on 
Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico, was eventually published in 1998, long after he had become famous.
 
From May 1962 to May 1963, Thompson traveled to South America as a correspondent for a Dow 
Jones-owned weekly newspaper, the National Observer. In Brazil, he spent several months as a 
reporter for the Brazil Herald, the country's only English-language daily, published in Rio de 
Janeiro. His longtime girlfriend Sandra Dawn Conklin (aka Sandy Conklin Thompson, now Sondi 
Wright) later joined him in Rio. They were married on May 19, 1963, shortly after returning to 
the United States, and lived briefly in Aspen, Colorado, where they had a son, Juan Fitzgerald 
Thompson (born March 23, 1964). The couple conceived five more times, but three pregnancies were 
miscarried, and the other two produced infants who died shortly after birth. Hunter and Sandy 
divorced in 1980 but always remained close friends.
 
In 1964, the family relocated to Glen Ellen, California, where Thompson continued to write for 
the National Observer on an array of domestic subjects. One story was about his 1964 visit to 
Ketchum, Idaho, to investigate the reasons for Ernest Hemingway's suicide.[18] While there, he

his ties with the Observer after his editor refused to print his review of Tom Wolfe's 1965 
essay collection The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby,[19] and moved to San
